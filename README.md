# AccidentalNoiseLibrary
A modified C# port of the Accidental Noise Library by Joshua Tippetts. It is still in need of some proper C# specific optimizations and the Color modules are missing for the time being. Included is a special XML reading module which is also work in progress.

Add in Unity by UPM:
1. Open Packages/manifest.json
2. Add to dependencies 
"com.custom.perlin_noise": "https://github.com/AlexMeSh/AccidentalNoiseLibrary.git"
3. Save 
4. Open Unity
